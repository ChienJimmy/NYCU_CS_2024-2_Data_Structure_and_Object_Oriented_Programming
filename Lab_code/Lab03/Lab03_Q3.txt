2059 . Lab 3 - Q3
Description
Complete the problem using the provided template.
You can only modify the code where there is a //TODO comment.

Bucket(int fish_, int bread_, string name_) 
Class constructor for the Bucket class.
fish_ specifies the number of fish fish.
bread_ specifies the number of loaves of bread bread.
name_ specifies the name of Bucket name.
Call show() and showAll() after construction.

a->SwitchFish(Bucket* b)
Switch the number of fish in Bucket a with the number of fish in Bucket b.
After switching, use show() to print :
“a's name has a's fish fish and a's bread loaves of bread.”
“b's name has b's fish fish and b's bread loaves of bread.”

a->SwitchBread(Bucket* b)
Switch the number of loaves of bread in Bucket a with the number of loaves of bread in Bucket b.
After switching, use show() to print:
“a's name has a's fish fish and a's bread loaves of bread.”
“b's name has b's fish fish and b's bread loaves of bread.”

a->ModifyResources(int fish_, int bread_)
Change the number of fish and the number of loaves of bread in Bucket a by fish_ and bread_, respectively.
Call show() and showAll() after modifying.

show()
Print the name, the number of fish, and the number of loaves of bread in a Bucket as:
“name has fish fish and bread loaves of bread.”

showAll()
Print the total number of fish and the total number of loaves of bread in all Buckets as:
“In total, there are fish fish and bread loaves of bread.”
