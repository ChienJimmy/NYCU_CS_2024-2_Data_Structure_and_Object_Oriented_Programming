Description
Set

Find the intersection, difference, and union of the two sets.
Please use <set> to complete this problem.

Input Format
The first line is an integer that represents the number of input set pairs.
In the following lines, every two lines represent one input pair.
They are all increasing sequences of integers. The first line of each pair contains the elements of set A, and the second line contains the elements of set B.
-1 is the stop marker.

2
1 2 3 4 5 -1
1 3 5 7 9 -1
1 3 5 7 9 -1
2 4 6 8 10 -1

Output Format
Output the intersection, difference, and union of the two sets as increasing sequences.
The outputs between each set pair should have an empty line.
If it is an empty set, please output "None".
intersection: A∩B
difference: A\B
unionSet: A∪B

intersection: 1 3 5
difference: 2 4
