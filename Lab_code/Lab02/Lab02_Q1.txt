Description
List

LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is a common caching algorithm used to manage limited-capacity cache memory, ensuring the storage of data most likely to be reused.
Its core functions are removing the least used data and maintaining the order of usage frequency.
Please use <list> to complete this problem.

Input Format
The input contains an integer and several operations.
The first line is an integer, representing the capacity of the LRU cache.
The following lines represent the operations of the LRU cache.
Each line contains a string operation and an integer.
The operations could be insert, read or exit.

The insert operation:

If the number already exists in the LRU cache, move it to the front of the LRU cache.
If the number does not exist in the LRU cache, put it to the front of the LRU cache.
The read operation:

If the number already exists in the LRU cache, move it to the front of the LRU cache.
If the number does not exist in the LRU cache, print "key [number] is not in LRU". (You don't need to add it to the LRU cache.)
The exit operation:

The end of the input.
Print the elements in the LRU cache in the format: "LRU [newest element->oldest element]".
3
insert 10
insert 20
insert 30
insert 40
read 20
read 30
read 50
insert 50
insert 20
exit

Output Format
key 50 is not in LRU
LRU 20 50 30
