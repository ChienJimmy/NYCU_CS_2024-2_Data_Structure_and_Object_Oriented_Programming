Description
2D array

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N, which indicates the number of matrix pairs.
The next 2N matrices are provided as input, where the (2i - 1)-th and (2i)-th matrices represent the 1st and 2nd matrices in the i-th matrix pair, for i = 1, 2, â€¦, N.
For each matrix:

A pair of integers r and c specifies the number of rows and columns, respectively.
This is followed by r lines, each containing c integers, which represent the elements of the matrix.

7                             4th row of 2nd matrix in the 2nd matrix pair.

Output Format
For each pair of matrix A (1st matrix) and B (2nd matrix), perform the following operation:

If the number of rows and columns in A and B are equal, print "Addition:" and the results of A + B.
If the number of rows and columns in A and B are equal, print "Subtraction:" and the results of A - B.
If the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B, print "Multiplication:" and the results of AB.
If the two matrices can't be added, subtracted, or multiplied, print "Can not do any operation."
Leave a blank line between each output above.
Print "---------------" between each matrix pair.

Addition:
2 2
3 3

Subtraction:
0 2
3 5

Multiplication:
1 -2
3 -4

---------------
Can not do any operation.
